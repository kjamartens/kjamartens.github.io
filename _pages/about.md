<h1>Welcome!</h1>

I am Koen J.A. Martens, a postdoc in the lab of Ulrike Endesfelder. I am excited to study biophysical processes in living cells with advanced single-molecule localization microscopy. I focus specifcally on dynamical protein interaction quantification in individual cells on the nanometer spatial scale and millisecond temporal scale. To this end, I have experience in computational quantitative single-molecule microscopy, microscope hardware development, and prokaryotic genomic manipulation.

I am positioned at Bonn University, Institute for Microbiology and Biotechnology in Bonn, Germany.
