<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p align= "justify">
I'm an experienced researcher and <u><a href="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/">Alexander von Humboldt</a></u> PostDoc alumni, engaged in exploring the intricate world of biophysical processes within living prokaryotic cells using advanced single-molecule localization microscopy. My primary focus lies in optical developments in the fluorescent, in vivo single particle tracking field, and in the quantification of dynamic protein interactions at the nanometer spatial scale and millisecond temporal scale in individual cells.  My expertise spans computational quantitative single-molecule microscopy, microscope hardware development, and prokaryotic genomic manipulation.

Currently based at the Imaging Physics department of the Technical Universiy of Delft, I am actively pushing boundaries in <u><a href="https://kjamartens.github.io//software/">computational methodology for single-molecule microscopy</a></u>. Feel free to <u><a href="https://kjamartens.github.io//contact/">reach out</a></u> if you have any questions or if you'd like to learn more about my research.
