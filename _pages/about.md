<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p align= "justify">
I'm a senior postdoc focused on single-molecule microscopy - both its methodological development and its application in prokaryotic protein-DNA interactions.
</p>
<p align= "justify">
Currently I am focused on developing state-of-the-art single-molecule microscopy methods by using event-based sensors, supported by a <u><a href="https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/">Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions postdoc fellowship</a></u>. Before this I was an <u><a href="https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/">Alexander von Humboldt</a></u> PostDoc, engaged in exploring the intricate world of biophysical processes within living prokaryotic cells. I'm also developing biologist-friendly autonomous microscopy software.
</p>
<p align= "justify">
My primary focus lies in optical developments in the fluorescent, in vivo single particle tracking field, and in the quantification of dynamic protein interactions at the nanometer spatial scale and millisecond temporal scale in individual cells. My expertise spans computational quantitative single-molecule microscopy, microscope hardware development, and prokaryotic genomic manipulation.

Currently based at the Imaging Physics department of the Technical Universiy of Delft, I am actively pushing boundaries in <u><a href="https://kjamartens.github.io//software/">computational methodology for single-molecule microscopy</a></u>. Feel free to <u><a href="https://kjamartens.github.io//contact/">reach out</a></u> if you have any questions or if you'd like to learn more about my research.
