EMBO will support the visit of Dr. Hammink to our laboratory. While he is also working with synthetic polymers, he uses this system to activate T-cells. Very interesting work from the group of Prof. Carl Figdor (Radboud University, Nijmegen). <br>
We will use our cutting-edge microscopy techniques to characterise the interaction between polymers and immune cells. I am confident that his visit will result in top science.
