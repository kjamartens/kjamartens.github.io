Congratulations **Hongbo**!
<br>
Dr. Hongbo Yuan will be joining us after the summer, to investigate forces from the cell or the ECM change the mechanical properties of the matrix and, more importantly, how this change affects biological functions. We are really looking forward to work with you on this.
