We were awarded with a project within the "KU Leuven Global PhD Partnerships with Melbourne University" program. The project, entitled <b> “Advanced cell models and multifunctional nanomaterials for light- mediated cancer therapies“ </b> is a collaboration with the group of Prof. Paul Mulvaney and Dr. James Hutchison (a previous post-doctoral researcher of KU Leuven, an a friend). <br>
The PhD position in Melbourne is already open, the position in KU Leuven will open in April/May.
