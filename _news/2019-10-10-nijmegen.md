The Marie-Curie project of Dr. Hongbo Yuan starts with a visit to his former lab, Kouwer's group at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. <br>
A collaboration that started 2 years ago, with the visit of Prof. Rocha. After that, Khaizheng Liu (Max) visited our lab, Johannes Vandaele visited Nijmegen, Dr. Hongbo Yuan got a competitive Marie-Curie fellowship and soon Dr. RÃ¶el Hammink will come for a short stay. <br>
A good example how collaboration between group with different background can drive science forward. <br>
