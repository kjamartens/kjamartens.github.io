Pierre is joining us as one of the two PhD students that will be working for the <a href="https://supercol.eu/"><b>SuperCol</b></a> project at KU Leuven. A highly interdisciplinary project, requiring very specific skills. Pierre, with his unique background, has impressed us since the first interview. Looking forward to get started!<br>
**Bienvenue Pierre!** <br><br>
