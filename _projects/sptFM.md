In this decade, the pharmacology field has been intensively exploring different approaches to deliver multiple drugs with a single **drug nano-carrier**, such as liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, and inorganic nanoparticles. The advantage of nanoparticle based drug delivery is the ability to unify pharmacokinetics by simultaneous delivery of multiple drugs to specific target cells.
