abstract: 'In TARDIS, an all-to-all distance analysis between localizations is performed with increasing temporal shifts. TARDIS outperforms existing tracking algorithms especially in complex conditions, and is even robust in scenarios that exceed the capabilities of current localization algorithms. Using TARDIS, we further show that measurements can be five-fold shorter without loss of information.'
