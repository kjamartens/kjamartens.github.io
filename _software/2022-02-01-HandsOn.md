abstract: 'This is an introduction to the required computational analysis of SMLM imaging, post-processing and typical data analysis. Importantly, user-friendly, ready-to-use and well-documented code in Python and MATLAB with exemplary data is provided as an interactive experience for the reader, as well as a starting point for further analysis. Our code is supplemented by descriptions of the computational problems and their implementation.'
