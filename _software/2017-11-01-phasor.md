installation_instructions: 'From ImageJ, run update, and select HohlbeinLab from the update sites. Then run ThunderSTORM and select the phasor-based sub-pixel fitting routine.'
abstract: 'Phasor-based sub-pixel localization is a very fast, model-free, 2D and 3D single-molecule localization algorithm that can easily reach millions of localization positions calculated every second on standard CPUs. Its accuracy is in line with Gaussian-based fitting routines.'
