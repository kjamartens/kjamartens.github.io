abstract: '
EVE is a specialized software for analyzing eveSMLM (event-based SMLM) data. Event-based sensors (EBS), or neuromorphic vision sensors, offer a novel approach to imaging by recording light intensity changes asynchronously, unlike conventional cameras that capture light over fixed exposure times. EVE offers an integrated platform for detection, localization, and post-processing, with various algorithmic options tailored for the unique structure of eveSMLM data.'
